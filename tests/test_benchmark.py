"""Regression test for the precision/recall benchmark harness (issue #76).

Runs the vuln_cases corpus (benchmark/ground_truth/vuln_cases/) through
scripts/benchmark.py's own scoring logic and asserts 100% recall. This
folds the benchmark's recall check into the normal test suite, so a rule
change that silently breaks a ground-truth case is caught by `pytest`,
not just by someone remembering to run the benchmark manually.

Requires the Opengrep binary (skipped entirely if not installed, matching
the project's convention -- CI does not install it currently, see
.github/workflows/ci.yml).
