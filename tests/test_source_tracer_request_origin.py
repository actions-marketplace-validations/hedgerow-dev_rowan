"""Regression tests for issue #270: `request.*` taint sources were classified
as function parameters, which floored SSRF/XSS/command-injection confidence.

`trace_source` looked up the *assignment* of a source snippet's root variable.
For `request.args.get("url")` the root variable is `request`, which is never
assigned in either major framework -- Flask imports it, Django passes it as a
view parameter -- so the lookup failed and returned ORIGIN_FUNCTION_PARAM
(0.3). `EnrichmentPass._apply_source_confidence` floors any finding whose
origin confidence is below its category threshold, and those thresholds are
0.5 for SSRF and 0.7 by default, so every request-sourced SSRF/XSS/cmdi flow
was reported at INFO with confidence 0.15 -- meaning the documented
`scan --severity high` CI gate passed textbook Flask SSRF.
