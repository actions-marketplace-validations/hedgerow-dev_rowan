"""Single source of truth for taint-finding confidence scoring (issue #123).

Before this module there were **two independently hand-picked** hop-confidence
ladders that disagreed on what the same thing was worth:

* cross-file taint (`CrossFilePass`): a linear decay
  ``max(0.25, 0.75 - hops*0.1)`` -- a *direct* flow scored 0.75.
* intra-file opengrep taint (`EnrichmentPass._score_confidence`): a step
  function 0.90 / 0.80 / 0.65 by hop bucket -- a *direct* flow scored 0.90.

So "one call-hop from source to sink" was 0.75 in one engine and 0.90 in the
other, for no articulated reason, and neither set of constants was tied to any
measurement. This module unifies them into one parameterised decay function of
the TRUE hop distance (now accurate thanks to the #163 worklist), keeping the
one dimension that legitimately differs between the two engines -- the base
trust -- as an explicit per-engine parameter rather than a divergent curve
shape:

* ``OPENGREP_TAINT`` has the higher base (0.90): opengrep's intra-file
  dataflow is a real (sound-ish) taint engine.
* ``CROSSFILE_TAINT`` has the lower base (0.75): ``CrossFilePass`` is a
  heuristic AST pass, so an equivalent hop distance is worth less.

These constants are meant to be **calibrated, not hand-picked**: run
``python scripts/benchmark.py --calibrate`` to sweep them against the labeled
corpus (requires ``ROWAN_VULN_APP_PATH``; see the script) and report the
precision/recall/F the current values achieve versus alternatives. Note the
confidence *value* is display/ranking only for taint findings -- the only
hard output gate is ``EnrichmentPass._apply_thresholds``' per-rule
``min_confidence`` (0.5), which no taint ladder value crosses -- so
recalibrating these numbers re-ranks and re-labels findings without changing
which ones are reported.

#: any deterministic engine produces, so it sits below `PATTERN_ONLY_CAP` --

#: `AUTHZ_BOLA_*`, which asserts something is MISSING, this confirms a
#: PRESENT structural relationship -- closer in kind to dataflow-confirmed
#: taint than to an absence heuristic. Deliberately not set as high as
#: `OPENGREP_TAINT`'s floor (0.65) though: "is this guard permission-shaped"
#: is itself a token-matching heuristic (`allowed`/`role`/`can_*`/...) with
#: its own false-positive risk a real dataflow trace doesn't carry. Given its

#: the two detectors' evidence shapes are different enough that recalibrating
#: them together would hide which one needs adjustment later.
